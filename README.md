## Your mission

> "Focus your research" - Bert

After learning at BeCode for a while, this quote will definitely ring a bell!
So if all went well, you're now in the possession of a lot of exercises focused on styling, a certain technique or a framework.

We're going to spend some time to make a portfolio in which we will be adding our best projects!

## General guideline:

### !! Keep it simple, you only have a week!
You will get the chance to work on it more during the summer-pastures.

### Set yourself some goals on what you would like to present.
Some inspiration:
- Add styling
- Play with effects (don't overuse, make it smooth)
- Clean your code / check for the best practises
- Add a readme to provide info for companies who'll see your project for the first time
- Think of useful extra features (but consider all of the above first)


## ðŸŒ± Must-have's

- Choose a framework to build your portfolio with.
- Your portfolio has to contain at least these topics:
  - About me
  - My projects
  - Contact info
- Make your portfolio presentable!
- Deploy your portfolio.

## ðŸŒ¼ Nice-to-have's

- Clean up another exercise and add it to your projects.

If you've done your job well, you'll certainly benefit from the result!
